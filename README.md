# Java-Game-
Coding pacman was difficult than I thought. I've used Dijkstra algorithm for the ghosts. I am open to any ideas to develop the game. You can fork and develop the game as you wish. We need to work on ghosts more. Because they sometimes go to a corner and wait there. Maybe we could decrease the interval time of changing random targets for the ghosts.
